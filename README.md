Fork of [mervyns' dealornodeal](https://github.com/mervyns/dealornodeal).

Forked primarily to serve a Mother's Day event.

Some minor modifications:
- Served via a flask app.
- Customised to allow configuration of the total prize, while keeping animations for appropriate values. 
- Lowered number of cases to 22, added clapping animation to lowest 3 prizes.
- Rebalanced prizes to increase payout. 
- Reordered prize display to be in order vertically, similarly to game show.
